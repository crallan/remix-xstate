# 📝 Remix + XState TODO List

A simple TODO list app demonstrating how to integrate **Remix** with **XState** for managing
application state in a declarative and predictable way.

## 🚀 What is this?

This is a proof of concept that uses:

- **Remix** – A fast, full-stack web framework for building modern web apps.
- **XState** – A library for managing state using finite state machines, ideal for apps with
  more complex logic.

The app allows you to add, complete, and delete tasks — all managed through a state machine.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Remix
- XState
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crallan/remix-xstate.git
   cd remix-xstate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 🧪 Why XState?

XState enables modeling app logic as state machines, making state transitions and side effects
easier to manage and reason about — especially in more complex flows.
